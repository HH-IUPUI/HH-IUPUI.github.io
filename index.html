                <p>Globalization has given people huge opportunities 
                to work in diverse communities. People from all over the world can work or 
                study as a part of a global team. Whether you are a part of a study process 
                that involves your participation in a project with international peers or 
                you are working in a global company that has employees with different 
                cultural background, it is crucial to find a common ground with people 
                that are culturally different. Especially in such uncertain times 
                as the Pandemic Corona Virus, people from all over the world should 
                get along with people that are so far away from us, but at the same time
                are a few clicks away. Besides, being in different time zones, there are plenty
                of different customs and behavioral habits that are essential to learn in order
                to succeed to work in a global classroom environment. </p>

                <p>Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework is focused on cross-cultural communication.
                Hofstede’s cultural dimensions explains how different values affect people’s behavior.
                The framework focuses on 6 dimensions that help to analyse different cultural behaviors:
                individualism-collectivism; uncertainty avoidance; power distance (strength of social hierarchy),
                masculinity-femininity (task-orientation versus person-orientation) and indulgence versus 
                self-restrain. </p>

                <p>We are not going deep into theory by analysing each dimension of well-known Hofstede’s framework,
                but we simply point out the main differences and similarities we found between the USA and Finnish
                cultures during our project collaboration. </p>

            <h2>Main features of American and Finnish cultures</h2>
            <h3>Greetings</h3>
                <p>The whole project has two teachers – one from USA and the other one is from Finland.
                While working on the project, the way students greet the teachers differ in American and Finnish
                cultures. In USA people tend to greet teachers by “Professor” / “Teacher” /”Dr Name” / “Mr Name”,
                while in Finland students simply call teachers by first name or “Teacher”. </p>
            
            <h3>Communication style</h3>
                <p>The USA communication is direct, clear and a “straight to business” relationship.
                American communication style is about being open, not being shy, asking direct questions and
                talking personal stuff. While Finnish people tend to be closed. Finns value a lot of privacy.
                In Finnish society it is common to be humble about own achievements.  </p>
                <p>In Finland there is no specific pronoun for “she” and “he”. In the Finnish language both 
                men and woman are addressed as “hän”. It proves that Finnish people are very gender - neutral 
                and value equality with no specific separation between men and women. </p>
            
            <h3>Lifestyle </h3>
                <p>In Finland, the main life purpose is on well-being. Finns do not tend to show off their 
                status. In USA people try to be the best. Americans freely talk about the success and 
                accomplishments, while Finns are very humble in that matter. </p>

            <h2>Behind the curtains!</h2>
                <p>This website is the subproject of the main collaboration 
                project of two educational institutes: IUPUI and HHUAS. The project has about 10 people
                from the American university and 10 ppl from Finnish university. The project’s main 
                purpose is to present the learning outcome of basic skills for Web Development. 
                The main website includes smaller websites.  The current website focuses on Intercultural
                communication in a Global Classroom: USA & Finland. </p>
                <p>The current website’s creators include two students from USA and two students from Finland.
                Therefore, the focus is on cultural differences and similarities between American and Finnish 
                cultures.</p>
                <p>This is a more fun-based project rather than a theory-based. Please do not take every 
                word seriously. We do not intend to state that these are 100 percent valuable findings on 
                American and Finnish cultures. However, we do believe it is important to get a look at how 
                cultures influence people’s behavior and therefore their activities on international projects. </p>
                <p>The project brought us together and we are glad to announce that we have got along with 
                each other while learning Web Development basics. </p>
